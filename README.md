RGB Of Life
===========

A concept for Conway's game of life using RBG color bits, in HTML/Javascript

From the HTML of the page:

This page [app] demonstrates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>
in what can be considered 24 dimensions. There are actually 24 simultaneous "games of life" being played on the
board, one for each bit in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">24 bit RGB color value</a> that
is the background of the square. However, since we naturally think of white as the "dead" color and black as the "alive"
color, the bits have been flipped in this demonstration so that 0 represents alive and 1 represents dead. Thus #fff,
which is white, represents a cell that is completely dead, even though all of the bits are "on".
